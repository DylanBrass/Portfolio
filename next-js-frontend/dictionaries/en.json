        "p1": "This website was the combination of everything we learned in CEGEP, we were tasked to find a client and fulfill the requirements they had.",
        "p2": "Our client was Corso Electric, which is a electrician company, they wanted a website to track their orders, and show themselves to the world.",
        "p3": "We used React and Spring Boot to make this website, as well as MySQL for the database."

        "p3": "The email is sent to the client with the parameters that are passed to the method.",
        "p4": "My goal with this method was to make it as easy as possible to send an email, so that my teammates could use it without any problem, and I tried to make it as verbosed and clear to use. I would say I succeeded in that, since a lot of people in my class ended up asking and copying my code."

        "p3": "This repository is being used by Champlain College - St. Lambert Computer Science students who are extending the Spring Boot Microservices Petclinic. This is a multi-section, multi-year project that teaches students about Scrum, version control, issue management, TDD, CI, and so much more.",
        "p4": "I was put in charge of the authentication microservice, this meant I had to become familiar with JWT's, Spring Security, Spring boot, Angular JS and many security concepts as well as java one's."

      "slide2": {
        "p1": "Since we were using Microservices, and I was asked by my teacher to not put the authentication/authorization logic in the api-gateway,\n                                I chose to create my own annotation and filters, on the left is my annotation, the next slide will show my filter.\n                         "

        "p2": "This was one of three filters I created, the other two were for verifying the token and for checking if the user was allowed to access the resource (Role checking). Both of these are found in the next slide if you wish to see it !"

        "p2": "This was the first time I ever did anything with multiplayer and even more so, this was my first game, I had a lot of fun, and it's something I expect to do again.",
        "p3": "As you can see when you watch the video on GitHub, there are a few bugs and polish problems, these are simply because we ran out of time since we were in our 4th semester with 7 classes and we needed to do other projects. We would all like to fix those. Otherwise more levels and cleaner multiplayer interactions are also on the list to do."
