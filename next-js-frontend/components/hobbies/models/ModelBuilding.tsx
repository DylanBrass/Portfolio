                Model building is a passion that allows me to combine precision and creativity. My focus lies in
                crafting intricate tank and plane models, with a particular emphasis on the Second World War era. The
                historical significance, engineering marvels, and stories of resilience from this period inspire my
                choice of subjects.

                Currently, I am engrossed in the meticulous process of building a 2-meter-long Bismarck model. This
                endeavor not only demands attention to detail but also requires a deep appreciation for the historical
                context and the engineering complexity of one of the most iconic battleships from World War II.

                Assembling these models is not just a pastime; it&apos;s a journey through history and a celebration of
                craftsmanship. The selection of materials, the careful study of historical references, and the patience
                required for such a sizable project all contribute to the gratification I derive from this hands-on
                pursuit.

                In parallel with my digital endeavors in software development, the artistry and precision required in
                model building echo in my coding practices. Each line of code, like each piece of a model, contributes
                to the overall design, reinforcing my belief that creativity and meticulousness are universal principles
                that transcend different forms of creation.
